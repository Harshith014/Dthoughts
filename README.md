# Dthoughts

## Overview

**Dthoughts** is a static website template designed using **Figma** and converted into **HTML** and **CSS** with basic functionality added through **JavaScript**. The project primarily serves as a visually appealing template with no interactive elements, except for the left sidebar, which opens and closes to display information. This project demonstrates proficiency in converting design prototypes into clean, responsive web code and implementing minimal JavaScript functionality.

## Project Highlights

- **Design with Figma**: The template design was fully created in **Figma**, focusing on clean aesthetics, layout structure, and responsive design principles.
  
- **Figma to HTML/CSS Conversion**: The design was converted to a fully responsive **HTML** and **CSS** template using the **Anima** plugin, which generates high-quality front-end code directly from Figma designs.

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: A minimal JavaScript functionality was added to provide interactivity to the template. The left sidebar can be opened and closed to display or hide additional information, showcasing a basic dynamic user interface.

- **Static Template**: This project is a template-only website, meaning it contains no clickable or interactive form fields or elements (e.g., buttons or input fields) other than the sidebar toggle.

- **Image Management**: All images used in the project were extracted from the Figma design and saved locally in the `img` folder.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and markup of the webpage, ensuring semantic layout and accessible content.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout control for a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Basic functionality for opening and closing the sidebar.
- **Figma**: Used as the design tool to create the visual layout of the website.
- **Anima Extension**: Employed to convert the Figma design into HTML and CSS code.

## Features

- **Figma Design Integration**: The project replicates the original design created in Figma, translated into web code while maintaining the structure, typography, and visual elements.
  
- **Responsive Layout**: The template has been optimized for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that the design adapts well to different resolutions.

- **Sidebar Functionality**: A single JavaScript function controls the left-side information bar, allowing users to toggle between displaying and hiding the content. This demonstrates simple yet effective DOM manipulation.

- **Static Template**: The project does not include any back-end or advanced front-end logic. Itâ€™s designed purely as a front-end template with a focus on layout, images, and basic interactivity.



## Usage

### Running the Project

   ```


## Dependencies

This project does not use any external libraries or frameworks, making it a simple, lightweight template. It relies only on HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements

While **Dthoughts** is currently a static template, future improvements could include:
- Making form fields and buttons interactive.
- Adding more complex JavaScript to enhance user experience.
- Implementing dynamic content loading or API integration for enhanced functionality.

## Tools Used

- **Figma**: Design tool used to create the visual layout and structure of the template.
- **Anima Extension**: A Figma plugin used to automatically convert the design into responsive HTML and CSS code.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The project was developed and edited using **VS Code**, a powerful code editor that integrates well with Figma through plugins like Anima.
